Although life has recently become anything less than business as usual during the COVID-19 pandemic, ICON is happy to share that when it comes to our work, it is, in a sense, business as usual.

We have long ago fully invested in our employeeâ€™s ability to work remotely through a secure VPN. As needed, we are able to communicate with one another through phone, email, instant messaging, and video conferencing using Microsoft Teams, Join Me, and ZOOM.  

While we share the hope of restored public safety and the return to normal business operations, we are prepared and committed to continue working with our clients and teaming partners regardless of the circumstances and with little disruption to business as usual at ICON.
