description: Culvert Analysis Complete!
---

The construction is complete on ICON Engineering's $1.1M culvert analysis and design project for Dawson Ranch in Cañon City, CO! This project began with a detailed 2D hydraulic analysis for the entire Dawson Ranch area including well over 100 drainage culverts. Based on this analysis, culverts were scored and ranked for future improvements. Once a construction budget was determined, ICON assisted the City in identifying and selecting culvert improvement locations that not only met the project budget but would also provide the best mitigation results given the limited number of culverts that could be addressed. Ultimately, ICON designed improvements at twelve culvert locations, nine of which were constructed providing significant storm runoff benefits to over 200 property owners. Thanks to thoughtful coordination, construction was completed 2 months ahead of schedule!

“The results are TERRIFIC! The design, construction work, and landscaping will result in Dawson Ranch being an even better and more valuable place to live than it was before work was done. Even the trails were improved where drainage work was done.” - Mike Gromowski, Dawson Ranch HOA Chair
