description: Big Win for Sanderson Gulch Project!
---

We are honored and excited to announce that our Sanderson Gulch Channel Improvements project won the Grand Award for Engineering Excellence at this year’s CASFM conference! Special thanks to everyone that worked with us along the way to bring this project to fruition: the City and County of Denver, the Mile High Flood District, Valerian, Great Ecology, San Engineering, HDR Engineering, Aztec Engineering, Base Tactical, Corvus Environmental, Kumar & Associates, Pinyon Environmental, Stolfus & Associates, Zoeller Consulting, Ralph L Wadsworth, Habitat Management, Inc, and BT Construction.

“Amazing! No other words; this structure exceeds all expectations. I had driven by it and it looked nice, but having stopped and walked around this new facility, I am truly amazed at how beautifully designed this space is, as well as the “natural” stream channel leading to it. Thank you so much for putting this level of effort into this. It makes a big difference in our City.” - Gordon Robertson, Director – Planning, Design and Construction
