ICON project engineers Nick Stone and Tyler Rosburg recently represented ICON
Engineering at the Children's Water Festival in Fort Collins. The festival,
which is sponsored by Fort Collins Utilities and Northern Colorado Water
Conservancy District (NCWCD), hosts 1,800 third graders from public and private
schools within the City. The festival provides fun, hands-on activities for the
students to learn about and become interested in a wide variety of water related
topics.

The ICON Engineering booth utilized a scale flood model to teach the students
about the basic principles of watershed hydrology and floodplain management. The
students enjoyed interacting with the model and learning along the way. ICON
Engineering looks forward to more events like this that educate and excite young
students.
