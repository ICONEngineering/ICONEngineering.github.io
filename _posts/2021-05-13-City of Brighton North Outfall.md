A big thank you to the City of Brighton for recently highlighting our North Outfall Regional Stormwater Drainage project on LinkedIn. This project involved redesigning their undersized storm drain system to increase its capacity through a new storm sewer outfall to the South Platte River. This ultimately alleviates frequent flooding in the area during rain events. ICON has designed Phases 1-3 over the last 10 years and it’s so rewarding to see the final phase come to completion.
