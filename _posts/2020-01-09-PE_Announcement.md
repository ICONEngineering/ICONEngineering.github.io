We would like to recognize our newest Professional Engineer, Jake McMillen. Congratulations on passing your PE exam, and adding value to the ICON team with this great accomplishment!
Professional licensure as an Engineer is required to bid on contracts and provide professional engineering and design services in the State of Colorado. The 8-hour test is difficult, and often requires months of intense study. With that in mind, ICON Engineering is excited to see Jake's hard work rewarded.
