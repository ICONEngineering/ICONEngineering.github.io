ICON Engineering mentored two Civil Engineering students from Vanderbilt University during the 2020-2021 school year through a partnership with Sterling Ranch. Sterling Ranch, a nearby 3,400 acre master planned community, provided the real-world location for these students to develop their senior design project. With the help of ICON Engineering, the students analyzed the hydrology and hydraulics of Willow Creek located within the developing community and ultimately designed stream restoration improvements that would accommodate future urban runoff.  The senior design project mimicked an actual design developed by ICON Engineering that will be constructed this year. Congratulations to Laurel Baldwin White and Zachary Bloom!
