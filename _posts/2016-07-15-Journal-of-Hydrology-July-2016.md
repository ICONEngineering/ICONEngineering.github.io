description: The effect of flow data resolution on sediment yield estimation and channel design
---
ICON Engineering staff engineer Tyler Rosburg recently published research in the
Journal of Hydrology[^1]. Tyler, along with a team from Colorado State University,
examined the effects of streamflow data resolution on the computation of
sediment yield and subsequent channel design.

The study utilized streamflow and sediment transport measurements from 138 sites
across the United States and computed effective discharge, half-load discharge,
and sediment yield over long time periods.  The study showed that daily-averaged
flow data do not adequately represent the magnitude of high stream flows at
hydrologically flashy sites. Daily-average stream flow data cause an
underestimation of sediment transport and sediment yield (including the
half-load discharge) at flashy sites. The study also provides practical charts
for estimating and correcting these types of underestimation errors commonly
incurred in sediment yield calculations.
