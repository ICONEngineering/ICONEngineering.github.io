ICON’s Craig Jacobson and Jeremy Deischer presented at the 2019 Colorado Association of Stormwater and Floodplain Managers (CASFM) Conference held in Crested Butte, CO. Craig's presentation focused on a “New Look for Manning's n Values” with Jennifer Bousselot, PhD. Jeremy, along with Sandra Bratlie of the City of Fort Collins, presented a case study of the Old Town Drainage Basin relevant to the Benefit Cost Analysis performed to prioritize capital improvements. We are proud to attend, present, and sponsor parts of this conference each year, as it has proven to be an excellent venue for networking and keeping up on industry trends. Great work Craig and Jeremy!
