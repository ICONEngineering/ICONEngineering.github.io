description: Fourmile Canyon Creek Restoration presentation at CASFM 2016
---

ICON Engineering staff engineer Tyler Rosburg recently
presented at the 27th annual Colorado Association of Stormwater and Floodplain
Managers (CASFM) Conference in Crested Butte, Colorado. Tyler presented on an
ICON Engineering project currently underway on Fourmile Canyon Creek in Boulder,
Colorado.

During the 2013 floods, thousands of cubic yards of sediment were deposited on
the creek’s floodplain. This increased the risk of flooding for nearby homes and
also put city infrastructure at risk. The project, sponsored by the Urban
Drainage and Flood Control District (UDFCD), and the City of Boulder, aims to
restore 1,500 feet of the creek to a safer and more resilient condition.

In his presentation, Tyler shared ICON’s sediment transport and flood risk
analyses as well as the 30% design. We look forward to seeing this project
progress further in the future, and ultimately benefit the people and City of
Boulder.
