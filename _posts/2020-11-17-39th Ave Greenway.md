description: Big Win for 39th Ave Greenway Project!
---

The design team for the 39th Avenue Greenway project in Denver was recently awarded Best Overall Project by CNU Colorado! In addition to providing flood protection, the design for this $80 million project enhances multimodal connectivity and improves water quality from an ecological perspective. The team was heavily engaged with the community in an inclusive process to improve the aesthetic and visual character of the corridor while respecting its historic industrial context. Designed for year-round use, amenities include: Denver’s first shared street, bridges, low-flow crossings, natural play areas, plazas, shade structures, wayfinding, water quality features and specialty areas for events and gatherings.

Generally speaking, green infrastructure requires a comprehensive understanding of the urbanized watershed from runoff, capture, conveyance, treatment, and flood mitigation. ICON’s dedicated staff involved in this project and their decades of experience in these features of modern day civil infrastructure were a highly valued combination during the design process. The team included: FHU, DHM Design, ICON Engineering, Liveable Cities Studio, ECI, Matrix Design Group, and SEMA Construction.
