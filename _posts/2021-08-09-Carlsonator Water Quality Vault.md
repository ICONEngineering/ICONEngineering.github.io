American West Construction LLC installed the "Carlsonator Water Quality Vault" at the City of Brighton's North Outfall project. The 6 ft. wide x 16 ft. long x 11 ft. tall vault will help improve the water quality of stormwater in the surrounding neighborhood before the runoff flows downstream into the South Platte River. So fun to watch this project come to fruition! @MHFloodDistrict #waterquality
