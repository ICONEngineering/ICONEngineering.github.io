2019 was filled with some memorable staff outings from our annual chili cookoff, the company summer picnic, to our Halloween costume contest and traditional holiday bowling competition. In addition the ICON Partners were kind enough to secure season tickets for the 2020 Rockies season, where ICONers across the board got to pick a few games to attend this upcoming season... Go Rockies!!
