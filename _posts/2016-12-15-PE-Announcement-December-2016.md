description: ICON staff earn their PE license.

Congratulations to ICON Engineering staff engineers Tyler Rosburg and Daniel
Loewen who recently passed the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam.
The 8 hour exam held on October 28th 2016 was the last step in the state
licensure process for both Engineers.

Professional licensure as an Engineer is required to bid on contracts and
provide professional engineering and design services in the State of Colorado.
The test is difficult, and often requires months of intense study. With that in
mind, ICON Engineering was excited to see the pairâ€™s hard work rewarded.
