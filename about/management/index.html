            <h4>Doug Williams, PE</h4>
            <p>
              As a Principal of ICON, Doug has a wide variety of engineering experience in water resources
planning, design and construction. He has completed numerous drainage and flood control
projects ranging from less than $10,000 to over $3M in construction costs. His practical
approach to problem solving has been coupled with an awareness of aesthetics that has
produced facilities that are functional as well as community amenities. Doug has successfully
completed projects for the Urban Drainage Flood Control District (UDFCD) and local cities,
counties, and towns throughout the Rocky Mountain Region.</p>

            <p>
              As a Principal at ICON, Matt has 33 years of experience in general civil engineering, including
water resources, park development and design, roadway design, utility design, and
development services. His water resource experience includes hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, water distribution system analysis, preparation of feasibility studies, and preliminary
and final design. Matt’s experience also includes projects related to trails, bridges, floodplains,
hydraulics structures, and transportation/roadways.</p>

            <h4>Craig Jacobson, PE, CFM</h4>
            <p>As a Principal at ICON, Craig has a strong background in water resource engineering with an
emphasis in floodplain management and hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Craig has managed
and designed a large array of stormwater improvements throughout the state of Colorado. Many
of these projects have included conduit and pipe systems, channel stabilization and restoration,
maintenance, detention, and water quality. Along with his design experience, Craig’s projects
routinely involve the preparation of specifications and project documents, cost estimating,
quantity take-offs, and construction management. He is a Certified Floodplain Manager (CFM)
and instructs classes on the ASFPM certification through CASFM. Through a contract with the
Urban Drainage and Flood Control District (UDFCD) funded by FEMA, he is responsible for
technical reviews of FEMA Letters of Map Changes within the Denver Metro region. His project
experience has included steady state and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling, stormwater
improvement and channel stabilization designs, channel restoration and maintenance, master
planning, and construction management. Additionally, he has completed benefit-cost analyses
for use in FEMA PDM grant applications. He has extensive knowledge in the use of HEC-RAS,
HEC-1; HEC-2; Flo-2D; SWMM 5.0, UD-SWMM CUHP, AutoCAD and GIS based systems.</p>

            <h4>Troy Carmann, PE, CFM</h4>
            <p>Troy is a Principal of ICON specializing in GIS and stormwater control projects along the Front
Range. His design work includes stream restoration, channel stabilization, and flood control
projects across numerous tributaries in the South Platte River Basin. Project designs have
required coordination with the Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Consultants, US Fish
and Wildlife Service, EPA, CDPHE, and local municipal entities. Additionally, Troy served as
Resident Engineer on a $3M stormwater project in the City of Fort Collins, a $2 million City of
Colorado Springs channel stabilization project, and several local stream restoration projects. He
directs ICON’s GIS Department and has been responsible for the production of countywide
DFIRMs through our FEMA Map Modernization projects in Colorado, South Dakota and
Wyoming. CWCB work includes the Benefit Cost Analysis for the State Flood Rules. Troy
routinely presents this work to city councils, commissions, and boards and has made multiple
presentations at national, state, and local conferences.</p>
