   To help our staff stay current in our industry, we provide monthly “lunch and learn” sessions in the office, providing an opportunity to do exactly that: have lunch together and learn something new! We also do monthly Field Visits followed by a Happy Hour where staff can listen to project design details on site, understand lessons learned, and see the real-life results of their work… followed by some social time. Lastly, we pay for membership dues to professional organizations and attendance at professional conferences/seminars to enhance our knowledge in our areas of expertise.
